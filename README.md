# Next.js + DRF Tutorial using NextAuth.js

## Overview

NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution.

This is an example application that shows how `next-auth` is applied to a basic Next.js app.

### About NextAuth.js

NextAuth.js is an easy to implement, full-stack (client/server) open source authentication library originally designed for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Serverless](https://vercel.com). Our goal is to [support even more frameworks](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/2294) in the future.

Go to [next-auth.js.org](https://next-auth.js.org) for more information and documentation.

Much of this tutorial is adapted from [this medium article by Mahieyin Rahmun](https://mahieyin-rahmun.medium.com/how-to-configure-social-authentication-in-a-next-js-next-auth-django-rest-framework-application-cb4c82be137).

> _NextAuth.js is not officially associated with Vercel or Next.js._
